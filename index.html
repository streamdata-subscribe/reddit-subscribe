        <p>This is a working prototype to demonstrate how APIs can be turned into streaming topical subscriptions, using an <a href="http://openapis.org/">OpenAPI</a> to define topical searches for Reddit, and allowing user to subscribe to and begin streaming each search from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/">the Reddit API</a>. Next we'll add the ability to OAuth with Reddit to increase the number of API calls you can make, as well as OAuth with Githb and then save the stream to a Github repository, while also handling multiple streams.</p>
        <p>If you <a href="http://oauth.apievangelist.com/reddit/?action=login">authenticate and obtain an OAuth token from Reddit</a> *, you will be able to make more API calls to their API. If you <a href="http://oauth.apievangelist.com/github/?action=login">authenitcate with GitHub and get a GitHub OAuth token</a> ** you will be able to save the an JSON responses to a private GitHub repository within your account.</p>
